                    live in New York
                    City, where I design the future.</h1>
                <p class="font-light text-gray-300 ">I’ve loved making things for as long as I can remember, and wrote
                    my first program when I was 6 years
                    old, just two weeks after my mom brought home the brand new Macintosh LC 550 that I taught myself to
                    type on.</p>

                <p class="font-light text-gray-300">The only thing I loved more than computers as a kid was space. When
                    I was 8, I climbed the 40-foot
                    oak tree at the back of our yard while wearing my older sister’s motorcycle helmet, counted down
                    from three, and jumped — hoping the tree was tall enough that with just a bit of momentum I’d be
                    able to get to orbit.</p>

                <p class="font-light text-gray-300 ">I spent the next few summers indoors working on a rocket design,
                    while I recovered from the multiple
                    surgeries it took to fix my badly broken legs. It took nine iterations, but when I was 15 I sent my
                    dad’s Blackberry into orbit and was able to transmit a photo back down to our family computer from
                    space.</p>

                <p class="font-light text-gray-300 ">Today, I’m the founder of Planetaria, where we’re working on
                    civilian space suits and manned shuttle
                    kits you can assemble at home so that the next generation of kids really can make it to orbit — from
                    the comfort of their own backyards.</p>
